3.Debugging
************
    Debugging is the process which we can analyse the code till the code is working fine.
    For Debugging process users are using Break Point.
    
    Break Point - is a point where we can start the execution step-by-step.
    
    Types of Break Points - 
    1.step over - For moving to next line

4. Oops concepts
*****************
    1. Inheritence
    2. Polymorphysm
    3. Abstraction
    4. Encapsulation
    5. Class & Object
    
    1. Inheritence
    ***************
       Acquring the properties of parent class to child class means child class object can call Parent variable + 
       Parent method +child variable +child method.
       
       Note : extends is the keyword used for inheritence
       
       Definition in terms - Inheritence is a relationship
       There are two types of relationships
